SmartTVs can be ticking time bombs. Often the TV operating systems contain serious gaps or are not kept up to date. A good solution can be a standalone MediaPC operating system. LibreElec runs on the weakest Raspberry and can be controlled with the TV's remote. LibreElec is more customizable than a SmartTv operating system and offers a variety of apps/modules. All you need is a RaspberryZeroW and a blank SD card.
## Step one:
Download the Noobs installer from https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/.
## Step two:
Unzip this zip archive to the empty SD card.

Done! Now you can connect the RaspberryPiZero to the TV. You will then see the installation menu.

Please select now "LibreElec RPI" and click on "Install".

After that the installation is finished and bootable

Now you can connect this MediaPc with external source such as NAS or install apps such as Youtube. I wish you a lot of fun!
