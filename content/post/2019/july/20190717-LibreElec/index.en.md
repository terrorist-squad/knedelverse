SmartTVs can be ticking time bombs. Often, the TV operating systems contain serious gaps or are not kept up to date. A good solution can be a standalone MediaPC operating system. LibreElec runs on the weakest Raspberry and can be controlled with the TV's remote. LibreElec is more customizable than a SmartTv operating system and offers a variety of apps/modules. All you need is a RaspberryZeroW and a blank SD card.
## Step 1:
Download the Noobs installer from https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/.
## Step 2:
Unzip this zip archive to the empty SD card.

As already written, you can also use your TV remote control via CEC controller.
