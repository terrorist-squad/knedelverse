The Corona crisis is hitting restaurateurs and caterers in Germany hard. Digital tools and solutions can help to get through the Corona pandemic as safely as possible.In this tutorial series "Creative from the crisis" I show technologies or tools that can be useful for small businesses. Today I'm creating a weekly menu for the "OUT OF HOUSE BUSINESS." You can find many menu templates at https://www.365layouts.com/de/vorlagen/menu/. You can also customize these templates instantly in the 365Layouts editor.
## Step 1: Find template
Select a template and click on " Use template". After that, you may need to authenticate yourself.
